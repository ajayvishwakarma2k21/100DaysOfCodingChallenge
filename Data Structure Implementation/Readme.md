> A comprehensive guide and implementation examples for essential data structures in Java. Includes best practices, things to take care of, and common pitfalls to avoid.

## ‚ú® Overview

A **data structure** is a method of organizing, storing, and processing data for efficient access and modification. In Java, you can use built-in structures (from `java.util`) or create your own custom implementations. This project covers both approaches, providing insight into their design and usage.

## ‚ö° Key Considerations When Implementing Data Structures

- **Correctness & Consistency**  
  Ensure your data structure maintains its invariants (e.g., order in BST, unique keys in HashMap) and implements all necessary operations properly.
- **Encapsulation**  
  Hide internal details and provide a clean, minimal public interface.
- **Efficiency**  
  Analyze and optimize for time and space complexity. Use the right structure for the task.
- **Type Safety**  
  Leverage Java generics to build type-safe data structures.
- **Memory Management**  
  Be cautious of object creation overhead and memory leaks.
- **Thread Safety**  
  Implement synchronization or use concurrent collections if required.
- **Robustness**  
  Handle edge cases, invalid input, and provide meaningful exceptions.
- **Reusability & Extensibility**  
  Design for future needs and code reuse.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Reinventing the wheel:**  
  Use Java's standard libraries unless you have a strong reason to implement custom structures.
- **Ignoring edge cases:**  
  Neglecting empty structures or null values leads to bugs.
- **Exposing internals:**  
  Never make internal fields public or return modifiable internal data.
- **Poor naming conventions:**  
  Use clear, descriptive names for all classes, methods, and variables.
- **Neglecting performance:**  
  Always consider the efficiency of your algorithms and data structures.
- **Over-synchronization:**  
  Only make things thread-safe if necessary; avoid unnecessary locks.
- **Memory leaks:**  
  Remove references to unused objects, especially in linked structures.

## üõ†Ô∏è Example: Custom Stack Implementation

```java
public class Stack<T> {
    private Node<T> top;
    private static class Node<T> {
        T data;
        Node<T> next;
        Node(T data) { this.data = data; }
    }

    public void push(T item) {
        Node<T> node = new Node<>(item);
        node.next = top;
        top = node;
    }

    public T pop() {
        if (top == null) throw new EmptyStackException();
        T item = top.data;
        top = top.next;
        return item;
    }
}
```
