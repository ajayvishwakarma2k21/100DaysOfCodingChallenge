# We make DP array of size n+1:

- To represent base cases (like 0 items, 0 steps, or empty string).
- To align with 1-based indexing.
- To make transition formulas cleaner (no special handling for boundaries).
- To avoid index out of range errors.

# üìò Dynamic Programming: 1D vs 2D DP

## üîπ General Rule
- **1D DP ‚Üí** when the state depends on **one variable**.  
- **2D DP ‚Üí** when the state depends on **two variables**.  
- Higher dimensions (3D, etc.) if more states are involved.  

---

## ‚úÖ 1D DP
### When to Use
- State depends on **one index/state**.  
- Usually linear progression (arrays, sequences, 1D paths).  

### Examples
1. **Fibonacci Numbers**  
   - State: `i` (nth number).  
   - Recurrence:  
     ``` 
     dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
     ```

2. **Climbing Stairs**  
   - State: `i` (steps).  
   - Recurrence:  
     ``` 
     dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
     ```

3. **Maximum Subarray (Kadane‚Äôs Algorithm)**  
   - State: `i` (end index of subarray).  
   - Recurrence:  
     ``` 
     dp[i] = max(nums[i], nums[i] + dp[i-1])
     ```

---

## ‚úÖ 2D DP
### When to Use
- State depends on **two indices/states**.  
- Common in **Knapsack, LCS, Edit Distance**.  

### Examples
1. **0/1 Knapsack**  
   - State: `(i, w)` ‚Üí item index, weight capacity.  
   - Recurrence:  
     ``` 
     dp[i][w] = max(dp[i-1][w], dp[i-1][w - weight[i]] + value[i])
     ```

2. **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**  
   - State: `(i, j)` ‚Üí indices of two strings.  
   - Recurrence:  
     ```
     if s1[i] == s2[j]:
         dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]
     else:
         dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
     ```

3. **Edit Distance**  
   - State: `(i, j)` ‚Üí operations needed for prefixes of two strings.  
   - Recurrence involves **insert, delete, replace** operations.  

---

## üîπ Space Optimization
- Many **2D DPs can be reduced to 1D** by keeping only the current & previous row.  

### Example: Knapsack (optimized)
