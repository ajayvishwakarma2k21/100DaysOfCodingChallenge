### ❓ **GENERAL DP QUESTIONS**

- **Q1: What is DP?**
    - DP stands for Dynamic Programming: a method to solve problems by combining solutions to subproblems.
- **Q2: When does a problem need DP?**
    - When it has _overlapping subproblems_ and _optimal substructure_.
- **Q3: What is a DP "state"?**
    - A unique combination of parameters that defines a subproblem (e.g., indices, sum, mask).
- **Q4: What is a recurrence relation?**
    - A formula expressing the answer to a state in terms of answers to smaller states.
- **Q5: Memoization vs Tabulation?**
    - Memoization = recursion + cache (top-down). Tabulation = fill a table (bottom-up).
- **Q6: Why do I need base cases?**
    - They are the simplest subproblems; without them, recursion cannot stop.
- **Q7: How do I avoid TLE (Time Limit Exceeded)?**
    - Use memoization/tabulation; avoid recalculating subproblems.
- **Q8: How do I debug DP?**
    - Print your DP table/array for small examples. Draw diagrams.
- **Q9: Why do I get wrong answers?**
    - Most often: wrong base cases, off-by-one indexing, or bad recurrence.

### ❓ **PATTERN-SPECIFIC DOUBTS**

**0/1 Knapsack**
- Why 2D DP?  
  *Because you track both item index and remaining capacity.*
- Why can't I use an item more than once?  
  *0/1 means each item is included at most once.*

**Bounded/Subset Sum**
- Why loop sum backwards?  
  *So each item is only counted once for any target sum.*

**Unbounded Knapsack / Coin Change**
- How is this different from 0/1?  
  *You can use items unlimited times (don't increment the item index after including).*
- Why does loop order matter?  
  *It controls whether you count permutations or combinations.*

**Palindrome DP**
- Why use 2D DP?  
  *You consider all substrings from i to j.*
- How to fill the table?  
  *By increasing substring length (bottom-up) or diagonally.*

**Coin Change (Min/Count)**
- Why initialize min coins DP with a huge value?  
  *To represent "impossible".*
- Why is dp[0]=1 for number of ways?  
  *There's one way to make 0: pick nothing.*

**Matrix/Grid DP**
- Why initialize first row/col separately?  
  *Movement is restricted; boundaries need special treatment.*
- What if there are obstacles?  
  *Set the cell's DP to 0 if blocked.*

**Subarray/Substring (Kadane’s, Sliding Window)**
- Why not use a DP table?  
  *These can be solved greedily or with sliding window (O(1) or O(n) storage).*
- When to use sliding window?  
  *When you need the longest/shortest substring with a property.*

**Subsequence DP**
- How is a subsequence different from a subarray/substring?  
  *It can skip elements, but order matters!*
- Why use 2D DP for LCS?  
  *You compare prefixes of both sequences.*

**Bitmasking DP**
- What is a bitmask?  
  *An integer where each bit represents an item’s chosen/visited state.*
- Why is it efficient?  
  *Encodes all subset states compactly, but only feasible for N ≤ 20.*

---

### ❓ **OTHER COMMON DOUBTS**

- **How do I optimize DP space?**  
  *Reduce from 2D to 1D if only previous row/column is needed, or use variables (Kadane's).*
- **Why do I get index out of bounds?**  
  *Check all your for-loops and base cases!*
- **Why is my answer off by one?**  
  *Typical DP bug: wrong start/end indices or loop ranges.*

# 🏆 **The 10 Most Powerful DP Patterns!** 🏆

---

### 1️⃣ 0/1 Knapsack

- **When?**  
  Choose items (each at most once) to maximize value under a weight limit.
- **State:**  
  `dp[i][w]` = max value for first `i` items and capacity `w`
- **Template:**
    ```java
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++)
        for (int w = 0; w <= cap; w++)
            if (weight[i-1] <= w)
                dp[i][w] = Math.max(dp[i-1][w], value[i-1] + dp[i-1][w - weight[i-1]]);
            else
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w];
    ```

---

### 2️⃣ Bounded/Subset Sum

- **When?**  
  Partition/subset sum, each item once.
- **State:**  
  `dp[i][sum]` = true/false if sum can be made with first `i` items.

---

### 3️⃣ Unbounded Knapsack / Coin Change

- **When?**  
  Unlimited supply: coins, rods, etc.
- **State:**  
  `dp[amount]` = min coins or number of ways to reach `amount`.

---

### 4️⃣ Palindrome DP

- **When?**  
  Palindromic substrings/partitions.
- **State:**  
  `dp[i][j]` = Is substring from i to j a palindrome?

---

### 5️⃣ Coin Change (Min/Count)

- **When?**  
  Min coins/ways to make sum.
- **State:**  
  `dp[amount]` = min coins or number of ways.

---

### 6️⃣ Unbounded Knapsack (Generalized)

- **When?**  
  Rod cutting, integer break, etc.
- **State:**  
  1D or 2D DP with total/target.

---

### 7️⃣ Matrix/Grid DP

- **When?**  
  Paths on a grid, unique paths, min path sum.
- **State:**  
  `dp[i][j]` = answer for cell (i, j).

---

### 8️⃣ Subarray/Substring (Kadane’s, Sliding Window)

- **When?**  
  Max subarray sum, product, longest substring with property.
- **State:**  
  O(1) variables or sliding window.

---

### 9️⃣ Subsequence DP

- **When?**  
  LIS, LCS, subset sum, distinct subsequences.
- **State:**  
  1D: `dp[i]`, 2D: `dp[i][j]` (for two sequences).

---

### 🔟 Bitmasking DP

- **When?**  
  Track which elements/items are picked/visited.
- **State:**  
  `dp[pos][mask]` or `dp[mask]`.

# 🌟 **Pro Tips & Pitfalls**

- **Base cases are everything!**  
- **Indexes:** The #1 DP bug is off-by-one.
- **Order matters:** For counting/permutations, loop order changes the answer.
- **Bitmasking:** Only for small N!
- **Sliding window:** Great for contiguous subarrays/substrings.
- **Draw it!** Visualize your DP table for small inputs.

# 🌱 **How to Grow Your DP Skills**

1. **Start with classics for each pattern.**
2. **Write out state, recurrence, and base cases before coding.**
3. **Print/draw your DP table for tiny cases.**
4. **Convert recursion to DP, then optimize space.**
5. **Ask for help—DP is a team sport!**

---

# 🎉 **REMEMBER:**  
> DP is NOT about memorizing code.  
> It’s about recognizing structure and building from smaller answers.

**Ask yourself:**  
- What’s my state?  
- What are my choices?  
- How do I combine smaller answers?
